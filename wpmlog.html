								<h2>Personal WPM log</h2>

								<h3 style="margin-bottom: 4em;">I only started learning PLOVER recently. I'm really curious how hard (or easy) it is to learn steno on your own. I thought it'd be cool to track my progress and look where my skill ceilings are. <a href="https://joshuagrams.github.io/steno-jig/" target="_blank">Joshuagrams</a> has a cool Plover tool, which generates random sentences, from which I grabbed my WPM data.</h3></b></b>

								<p>Typing on HP Elitebook 8470p (non-NKRO). I first downloaded Plover on my every-day laptop. Arpeggiating became an aggrevating thing, so I started to look at NKRO options.</p>

								<p><coloured>22 | </coloured>Redragon Kumara arrives. (Free shipping on Amazon, wowzers.) And my gosh what a change. I didn't know how much I needed mechanical Outamu Blues in my life. It is nice not having to smash the keyboard to get a beautiful crunch. For the price, I don't know how I can do better. I rotated some of the key caps to help me with learning to touch-type in steno. For example, it is a lot easier to find and press multiple keys when they are rotated to face eachother. The only downside is it sorta takes away from the backlight experience.</p>	
							
								<p><coloured>27 | </coloured>I'm struggling with pain in my right wrist. My left hand seems to have adapted well to cording in steno, but my right, not so much. I haven't felt the same stiffness from typing QWERTY, so I've been concerned whether there's an issue in my form I'm not sure about. I've played with changing the default Plover layouts and changing the elevation and tilt of my keyboard. Have yet to be sure of the cause of the issue. Maybe my form would benefit from a 60% keyboard instead of a 10-keyless. I wonder if has something to do ulnor deviation specifically in the right hand, which may the the side effect of me pressing the D and Z steno keys by reaching my pinky. There is especially pain with typing "thing". I reviewed some videos of me typing and I think it has something to do with the awkward stagger that leaves the vowel keys under the right palm in a position less natural than that of the left's.</p>
